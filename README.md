# Offensive Security Playbook 🔴

A structured and ethical offensive cybersecurity knowledge base documenting real-world attack methodologies, tools, lab-based exploitation, detection techniques, and mitigations.

This repository represents my hands-on cybersecurity learning journey, focused on offensive security (red teaming) while maintaining strong ethical and defensive awareness.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

- Document offensive security attacks in a **structured and professional manner**
- Practice attacks **only in authorized lab environments**
- Build a personal **red team knowledge base**
- Demonstrate practical cybersecurity skills to recruiters and security teams
- Bridge the gap between **attack execution and defense/detection**
